This drive contains two partitions:
  1. A 1GB "BackupTools" NTFS filesystem which contains this file and utilities 
     for backups/encryption.
  2. A "Raw" partition which contains no apparent filesystem, and must be 
     mounted using VeraCrypt and the encryption passcode.
    
DO NOT FORMAT THE CONTENTS OF EITHER PARTITION
